# Hive

Attempt of building an actor based simulator in Elm. Maybe I'll make it into a game one day.

## Setup

You need:

  - [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/),
  - [Elm Live](https://github.com/tomekwi/elm-live) (can be installed using `npm install`),
  - [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) (it's a requirement for Elm Live).

If you use [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) run:

```sh
nix-shell
```

Otherwise install the dependencies your own way.

## Run

```sh
scripts/develop
```
